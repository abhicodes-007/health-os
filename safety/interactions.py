"""Drug interactions — a hard interim guardrail (plan 3.6, v3).

The LLM is NOT an interaction engine (it hallucinates both ways). Until a deterministic DDI
layer EXISTS, the system REFUSES to assess interactions and does not let the LLM answer "can I
take X with my medications". The exception — a few deterministic rules that can actually be
computed:
  1) the total daily paracetamol dose across all products (the main real risk — paracetamol
     in 3 combination OTCs at once);
  2) biotin before TSH/troponin distorts immunoassays.
