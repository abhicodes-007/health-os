"""Critical-values rule-engine (plan 4.5).

The system's most dangerous scenario is built-in false reassurance: potassium 6.8 stuck
in pending at 23:00, in the morning "how are you?" → "no abnormalities". So critical values
are assessed by deterministic code at the ingestion stage, BEFORE review, and force-shown.

The core is the pure function `evaluate()` over a list of thresholds (easy to test without a DB).
`load_thresholds()` pulls thresholds from the critical_thresholds table.

High-recall by design: the bound is inclusive (>= / <=), a false escalation is better than a
miss. Unit gate: a threshold fires only when the value's unit = the threshold's canonical unit
(otherwise "glucose 95 mg/dL" would be falsely compared to a threshold in mmol/L).
